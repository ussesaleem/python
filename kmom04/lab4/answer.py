# Exercise 2.1 (1 points)
#
# Create a new Python file called `physics.py`. Import your new file/module
# in `answer.py` using the import statement: `import physics`

# In your physics module create a function `free_fall` that calculates the
# speed after a free fall without air resistance. The function takes two

# Tip: the formula for calculating the speed of a free fall without air
# resistance is:
#
#     speed = initial speed + g * time, where g = 9.82

# Kinetic energy describes the energy of an object with a certain mass (m)

# Create a function `kinetic_energy` that calculates the amount of kinetic

# The formula for calculating kinetic energy is:
#
#     energy = 0.5 * m * vÂ².

# Exercise 2.4 (2 points)
#
# Potential energy is the energy stored in an object by virtue of the objects
# position in a gravitational field. The higher an object is lifted the
# greater the potential energy.
#
# The formula for calculating the potential energy is:
#
#     energy = m * g * h
#
# with m being the mass of the object, g the gravity and h the height of the
# object.
#
# When an object falls, all of the potential energy is converted into kinetic
# energy. So it is possible to calculate the height of the fall based on the
# amount of kinetic energy an object has at the end of the fall using the
# following formula:
#
#     height = kinetic_energy / (m * g)
#
# Create a function `height` that calculates the height of a free fall of
# time = 8 for an object with m = 10 and g = 9.82. Use your already defined
# functions `free_fall` to calculate the velocity and `kinetic_energy` the
# kinetic energy.

# Exercise 3.1 (3 points)
#
# Whether a certain year is a leap year depends on a few different rules.
# There is a leap year every year whose number is perfectly divisible by four
# - except for years which are both divisible by 100 and not divisible by
# 400. The second part of the rule effects century years. For example; the
# century years 1600 and 2000 are leap years, but the century years 1700,
# 1800, and 1900 are not.
#
# Create a function `leap_year` that checks whether a certain year is a leap
# year. The function should take one argument.
#
# Then create another function `leap_decider` that takes two arguments:
# `start_year` and `end_year`. The return value from the function should be a
# string containing the years and whether the years are leap years.
#
# Example: With the arguments `start_year`: 1999 and `end_year`: 2005, the
# string would be:
#
# 1999 is not a leap year, 2000 is a leap year, 2001 is not a leap year, 2002
# is not a leap year, 2003 is not a leap year, 2004 is a leap year, 2005 is
# not a leap year

# 2004.

# Exercise 3.2 (3 points)
#
# Create a function `multiplication_table` that returns a multiplication
# table from 1 up to the argument given. As 4 * 3 = 3 * 4 you only need to
